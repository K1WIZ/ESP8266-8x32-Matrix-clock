# ESP8266-8x32-Matrix-clock
ESP8266 Internet based clock using 8x32 MAX7219 FC16 Display

*** LOOKING FOR CONTRIBUTORS TO COLLABORATE ON IMPROVEMENTS! ***
*** Improvements Welcome!  Just submit a pull request! ***

Improvements Desired:

1) ~~Use NTP to acquire time~~
2) ~~Use WiFiManager to setup wifi and some user variables (ie. time offset float)~~
3) ~~Add configurable option for 12hr time instead of 24hr~~ - via wifimanager invokation
4) ~~update code to work properly with ESP8266 Boards version 2.5.x and later~~

NOTE: To avoid compile errors, you must be using 2.4.x stable ESP8266 Board Files in your Arduino IDE.  If you're using v2.5.x,
you can downgrade and compilation will be error-free.
